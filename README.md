# Todo

### Motivation
A todo manager that is no-frills, can maange todo lists on a day-to-day basis

### Status
Work in progress. The two major things that I'm hoping to do:

1.  Refactor/clean up code (I hacked this together in less than an hour).
2.  Store todo lists in txt files in some directory. Now, open a new txt file per day. Now, manage todo lists from day-to-day.

### Usage

    $ ./todo

### Output

    ------------- TodoManager (v.0.0.0) --------------
